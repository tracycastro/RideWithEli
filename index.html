            <p>In <span class="days"></span> days, I’ll be riding my bike 150 miles through the Texas Hill Country in
                the
                <span class="ride"></span>. My goal is to end Multiple Sclerosis forever.</p>

            <p>Millions suffering from MS need our help. The last year has been particularly tough on people living with
                MS
                –
                drastic shortfalls in funding for National MS Society and other nonprofits has hampered the aid, support
                and
                research that this community depends on. With your help, I aim to raise $<span class="target"></span>
                for
                the
                National MS Society – I’ve still got $<span class="remaining"></span> to go to hit that goal.</p>

            <p>It has been a wreck of year by any standard. I hope you are well and can take a beat just to acknowledge
                what
                a
                rock star you are for surviving it all. After that, if <a

                    target="_blank">donating to this cause</a> fits into your plans, I’d surely appreciate the help.</p>
